h1. Anup Bishnoi's Config Files

a.k.a. dot files

h2. Install

* Fork this repository, git clone and change into the cloned directory. 
* Enter your own name, email and repository at the end of install.sh 
* Copy your id_rsa.pub, id_rsa and known_hosts in ~/.ssh
* Run:

<pre>
./install.sh
</pre>

This will create symlinks for all config files in your home directory. You can
safely run this file multiple times to update.

h2. Scripts

Some of the aliases and vim shortcuts use these scripts:

http://github.com/jferris/scripts

Just clone that repository and add it to your PATH.

h2. Fresh ubuntu install

If it's a fresh ubuntu install:

<pre>
./firstboot.sh
</pre>

This will set the machine up with build-essential, node.js, npm, and other important packages
