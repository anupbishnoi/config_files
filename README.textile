h1. Anup Bishnoi's Config Files

a.k.a. dot files

h2. Install

Fork this repository, git clone and change into the cloned directory, and run:

<pre>
./install.sh
</pre>

This will create symlinks for all config files in your home directory. You can
safely run this file multiple times to update.

h2. Scripts

Some of the aliases and vim shortcuts use these scripts:

http://github.com/jferris/scripts

Just clone that repository and add it to your PATH.

h2. Fresh ubuntu install

If it's a fresh ubuntu install, run:

<pre>
./firstboot.sh
</pre>

This will set the machine up with build-essential, node.js, npm, and other important packages
